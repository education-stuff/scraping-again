# Data & Configuration

This section describes the data files, configuration, and logs generated and used by the scrapers.

---

### `scraped_data/`

*   **Purpose**: This is the main output directory for all successfully scraped data.
*   **Structure**: The data is organized into subdirectories based on the test series (e.g., `Free_Practice_Test`, `Advanced_Online_Test`), and then by subject (e.g., `Math`, `English`).
*   **Format**: Each file is a JSON array of question objects. Each object contains the question ID, stem, stimulus, answer choices, correct answer, explanation, and metadata.

### `oneprep_cookies.json`

*   **Purpose**: This file stores the authentication cookies required to access the OnePrep website.
*   **Functionality**: The scrapers load these cookies into the `requests` session to appear as a logged-in user.
*   **How to Obtain**:
    1.  Log in to `oneprep.xyz` in your web browser.
    2.  Open the developer tools (F12).
    3.  Go to the "Network" tab.
    4.  Find a request to a question page.
    5.  Copy the `Cookie` value from the request headers.
    6.  Paste it into this file, ensuring it's in the correct JSON format.
*   **Security**: This file is sensitive and should not be shared publicly. It is included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control.

### Test Data JSON Files

*   **Files**: `test_math_module_1_all_questions.json`, `test_v2_output.json`, `test_v2_output_english.json`
*   **Purpose**: These are sample output files generated by the various testing scripts.
*   **Usage**: They serve as a reference for the expected output format and can be used for regression testing to ensure that changes to the scraper don't break the output structure.

---

### Log Files

*   **Files**: `math_rescrape.log`, `module_2_hard_scrape.log`
*   **Purpose**: These files contain the log output from specific scraping runs.
*   **Functionality**: They are useful for post-mortem analysis of a script's execution, capturing errors, progress messages, and other important information that was printed to the console.
