A margin of error expresses the amount of random sampling error in a survey’s results. The margin of error is 4.4%, meaning that results within a range of 4.4% above and 4.4% below the estimate are reasonable. Since the estimated percentage of registered voters that will support the referendum is 60%, subtract the margin of error to get 60% – 4.4% = 55.6%, and add the margin of error to get 60% + 4.4% = 64.4%. The most appropriate conclusion is that between 55.6% and 64.4% of registered voters will support the referendum. Eliminate (A) because it is only the margin of error, not the range of possible values. Eliminate (B) because it is only the estimated percent of registered voters that will support the referendum; it doesn’t include the margin of error. Eliminate (D) because it accounts for only the lower range of likely results; in addition, it is unlikely that the percentage will be less than the lower end of the range. Choice (C) correctly matches the range and says that it is likely that the estimated number of registered voters that will support the referendum is within that range. The correct answer is (C).\n                        </div>",

The question states that <em>a</em> &lt; 0, so the correct value is –3, and (C) is correct.</p>\n<p>To solve algebraically, start by substituting –<em>x</em> + 6 for <em>y</em> in the first equation to get –<em>x</em> + 6 = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> – 6<em>x</em> – 18. Put the quadratic into standard form by setting one side equal to 0.

    "explanation": "<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-3\">Explanation</h2>\n<div>\n<p>The question asks for a value given a specific situation. One method is to translate the English to math in Bite-Sized Pieces and use the built-in calculator. Use <em>x</em> to represent the weight of 1 pair of earrings and <em>y</em> to represent the weight of 1 necklace; write this on the scratch paper to remember it. The question states that <em>The first employee weighs 4 pairs of earrings and 2 necklaces and obtains a weight of 38.8 grams</em>. Translate the weight of 4 pairs of earrings as 4<em>x</em>, the weight of 2 necklaces as 2<em>y</em>, and the total weight as 38.8. The translated equation is 4<em>x</em> + 2<em>y</em> = 38.8. The question also states that <em>The second employee weighs 1 pair of earrings and 5 necklaces and obtains a weight of 42.1 grams</em>. Translate this scenario the same way to get <em>x</em> + 5<em>y</em> = 42.1. Enter both equations into the built-in calculator, and then scroll and zoom to see that the lines intersect at the point (6.1, 7.2). The question asks for the weight of 1 pair of earrings, which is represented by <em>x</em>, so the weight of 1 pair of earrings is 6.1 grams, and (A) is correct.</p>\n<p>Since the question asks for a specific value and the answers contain numbers in increasing order, another approach is to plug in the answers. Rewrite the answer choices on the scratch paper and label them as “weight of 1 pair of earrings.” Next, start with a number in the middle and try (B), 6.5. The question states that <em>The first employee weighs 4 pairs of earrings and 2 necklaces and obtains a weight of 38.8 grams</em>. If 1 pair of earrings weighs 6.5 grams, 4 pairs of earrings weigh (4)(6.5) = 26 grams. Subtract this from the 38.8 grams that the first employee weighed to get 38.8 – 26 = 12.8 grams for the two necklaces. Divide 12.8 by 2 to get 6.4, which is the weight of 1 necklace. The question also states that <em>The second employee weighs 1 pair of earrings and 5 necklaces and obtains a weigh of 42.1 grams</em>. Plug in 6.5 for the weight of 1 pair of earrings and 6.4 for the weight of 1 necklace to get 42.1 = 6.5 + 6(6.4), which becomes 42.1 = 6.5 + 38.4, and then 42.1 = 44.9. This is not true, so eliminate (B).</p>\n<p>It may be difficult to determine whether a larger or smaller value is needed, so pick a direction and try (A), 6.1. If 1 pair of earrings weighs 6.1 grams, 4 pairs of earrings weigh (4)(6.1) = 24.4 grams. Subtract this from the 38.8 grams that the first employee weighed to get 38.8 – 24.4 = 14.4. Divide 14.4 by 2 to get 7.2, which is the weight of 1 necklace. Plug 6.1 grams for the weight of 1 pair of earrings and 7.2 grams for the weight of 1 necklace into the second scenario to get 42.1 = 6.1 + 5(7.2), which becomes 42.1 = 6.1 + 36, and then 42.1 = 42.1. The weight of 1 pair of earrings, 6.1 grams, and the weight of 1 necklace, 7.2 grams, was the same in both scenarios, so (A) is correct.</p>\n<p>Using either of these methods, the correct answer is (A).</p>\n</div>",

Start by drawing a figure to represent the scenario. The question describes a force that is applied perpendicular to the surface of two flat circular discs of different sizes, so draw two circles. The question gives information comparing the radii of the two circles, so add a radius to each circle. The drawing should look something like this:<br/><br/>\n<div><img alt=\"The figure presents two circles, with the larger circle on the left.

The question asks about the force on the smaller disc and gives the force on both discs. Use the area of the smaller disc and the combined area of the two discs to set up a proportion, using a variable, such as <em>f</em>, to represent the unknown force: <img align=\"middle\" alt=\"fraction numerator f over denominator x straight pi squared end fraction space equals space fraction numerator 3 comma 400 straight pi over denominator 17 straight pi x squared end fraction\" height=\"45\" src=\"https://cdn.princetonreview.com/EvaluativeContent/DigitalSAT/173de581-a9e1-4ff6-ae73-9e826f67085d_9ebe99bf-49ac-4b81-afd0-b9887d3e0015.svg\" style=\"max-width: none; vertical-align: -18px;\" width=\"123\"/>. Cross-multiply to get (<em>f</em>)(17π<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>) = (π<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>)(3,400π).

Recall that the combined surface of the two discs can be represented by 17π<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>. Set as equal the two ways to represent the combined area of the two discs to get 17π<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 68π. Divide both sides of the equation by 17 to get π<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 4π. Divide both sides of the equation by π to get <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 4. Take the positive square root of both sides of the equation to get <em>x</em> = 2. This is the radius of the smaller circle. Thus, the area of the smaller circle is <em>A </em>= π(2)<sup>2</sup> or <em>A</em> = 4π. The pressure remains constant at 50 pascals, so plug this and the area of the smaller circle into the <img align=\"middle\" alt=\"P space equals space F over A\" height=\"41\" src=\"https://cdn.princetonreview.com/EvaluativeContent/DigitalSAT/173de581-a9e1-4ff6-ae73-9e826f67085d_653cd008-88e9-4b57-a4a4-15d98cb05eb8.svg\" style=\"max-width: none; vertical-align: -15px;\" width=\"58\"/> formula to get <img align=\"middle\" alt=\"50 space equals space fraction numerator F over denominator 4 straight pi end fraction\" height=\"42\" src=\"https://cdn.princetonreview.com/EvaluativeContent/DigitalSAT/173de581-a9e1-4ff6-ae73-9e826f67085d_c5e4b8d0-7afb-4e83-ac89-cc1e20588659.svg\" style=\"max-width: none; vertical-align: -16px;\" width=\"73\"/>. Multiply both sides of the equation by 4π to get 200π = <em>F</em>. Multiply 200 by π and round to the nearest integer to get 628, which is correct.</p>\n<p>Using either of these methods, the correct answer is 628.</p>\n</div>",
