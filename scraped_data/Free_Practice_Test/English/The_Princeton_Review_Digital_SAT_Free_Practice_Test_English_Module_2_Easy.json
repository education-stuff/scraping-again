Next, look for a similar idea in Text 2 to see how its author feels about this view. Text 2 begins by acknowledging that <em>nostalgia</em> <em>is associated with mental health benefits</em> but then draws a contrast by saying that <em>there are different types of nostalgia</em> and <em>some can be highly destructive</em>. Then, it describes a study that found that some <em>more unconscious nostalgic experiences can result in negative mental health effects.</em> Therefore, the psychologists in Text 2 would “say some kinds of nostalgia are bad.” Write that in the annotation box and use Process of Elimination.<br/><br/>\n<ul>\n<li>(A) and (C) are wrong because they are only positive, but the texts express disagreement.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>(B) is correct because it matches the annotation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>(D) is wrong because Text 2 never mentions <em>future research.</em></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

The first piloted hot air balloon was designed in France, but it heated the air on the ground and came with a large risk of explosion. __________ Yost’s balloon design involved heating the fuel in the air and was much safer.</div>",

The preceding sentence says <em>The first piloted hot air balloon…heated the air on the ground and came with a large risk of explosion</em>, and this sentence says <em>Yost’s balloon design involved heating the fuel in the air and was much safer.</em> These ideas disagree, so an opposite-direction transition is needed. Make an annotation that says “opposite.” Eliminate any answer that doesn’t match.<br/><br/>\n<ul>\n<li>(A) is wrong because it is a same-direction transition.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>(B) is correct because <em>On the other hand</em> is opposite-direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>(C) and (D) are wrong because they do not convey the comparison between <em>Yost’s balloon</em> and the <em>first piloted hot air balloon</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
