The question asks how <em>the author of Text 2 </em>would respond to <em>the claims of the author of Text 1</em>. Start by understanding the<em> claims of the author</em> in Text 1. Text 1 describes a theory that <em>an escalation in infighting </em>that <em>coincided with increasing droughts caused the decline of the Ancient Maya societies</em>. It goes on to say that <em>climate change</em> was behind <em>the</em> <em>demise </em>of the societies. Next, look for a similar idea in Text 2 to see how its author feels about this view. Text 2 acknowledges that the <em>drought conditions…were correlated with the fall of the social order and the rise of civil unrest</em> but contrasts this by stating that <em>it was more specifically the increasing unpredictability of precipitation patterns</em>. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would “say it’s unpredictable precipitation patterns rather than drought.” Write that in the annotation box and use Process of Elimination.<br/><br/>\n<ul>\n<li>(A) is wrong because Text 2 states that <em>it is often correctly pointed out that drought conditions…were correlated</em> with the social unrest, so Text 2 doesn’t disagree with this view.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>(B) is wrong because this statement isn’t related to anything from Text 1.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>(C) is correct because it matches the annotation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>(D) is wrong because Text 2 never says what <em>would have</em> happened.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
