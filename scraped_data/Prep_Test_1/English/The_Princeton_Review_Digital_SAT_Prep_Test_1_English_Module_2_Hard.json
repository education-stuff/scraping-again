Read the text and highlight the hypothesis, which states thattau protein, the mutation of which is known to cause Alzheimer’s disease, is key to controlling glutamate receptors.It’s also important to note the last sentence, which clarifies thatTau protein does not directly affect glutamate receptors but does inhibit NSF.The correct answer should be consistent with these two sentences.(A) is correct because ifan excess of NSF has been shown to lead to abnormal glutamate receptor behavior,andtau protein…does inhibit NSF,this would support the link made between tau proteins and glutamate receptors made in the hypothesis.(B) and (D) are wrong because even if true, they either disregard or do not mentiontau proteinandglutamate receptors,the main components of the hypothesis.(C) is wrong because the hypothesis is not aboutwhat causesmutations of tau protein, but how tau protein controls glutamate receptors.close",

Some economists, such as Charles Kindleberger, argue that tulip mania was the first speculative bubble in history, during which the prices of a commodity (in this case tulip bulbs) do not follow the typical rules of economics. Others, such as Peter Garber, believe that tulip mania is explainable by fundamental economic concepts such as supply and demand.",
