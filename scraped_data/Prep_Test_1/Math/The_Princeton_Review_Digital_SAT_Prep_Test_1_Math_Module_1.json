The question gives the area of the triangle, so write out the formula for the area of a triangle,, and plug in the given area to get. Since the question asks for a specific value and the answers contain numbers in increasing order, plug in the answers. Write the answers on the scratch paper, label them as “m,” and start with a middle number. Try (B), 9. Ifm= 9, the base of the triangle is 9 + 5 = 14, and the height of the triangle is 9. Plug these numbers into the area formula to get. Simplify the right side of the equation to get 18 = 63. This is not true, so eliminate (B). The result was too big, and a larger value ofmwill make the area even bigger, so eliminate (C) and (D), as well. The correct answer is (A).close",

The question states that the systemhas exactly one solution. To determine the number of solutions to a quadratic, use the discriminant. The discriminant is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root sign, and it can be written asD=b2– 4ac. When the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has exactly two real solutions; when the discriminant is 0, the quadratic has exactly one real solution; and when the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real solutions.
