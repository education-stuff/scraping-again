    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for the median of a set of data. The median of a list of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. In lists with an even number of numbers, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Count to see that there are 7 numbers in the list. Since there is an odd number of numbers, the median is the middle number. Since this list is already in order, cross out one number at a time from each end until only the middle number is left, like so:33,34,38, 41,43,44,47. The middle number is 41, so the median is 41.

Then label the sides of triangleABCwith the lengths given in the question. The drawing should  look something like this:The question asks for the cosine of angleL, which corresponds to angleA.
