    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for the change in a value given a proportion. Use the geomtry basic approach. Start by drawing two triangles, one with a smaller base than the other. The question asks about the height, so draw a line for the height. This figure should look something like this:Next, label the figure with the information given. Since no specific numbers are given for the base and the height, plug in. Make the height of the larger triangle 100, so the base would be 65% of 100 or just 65. If the base decreases by 13 inches, the new base would be 65 – 13 = 52.Label this information on the figure, which now looks like this:Since the base is smaller and the proportions stay the same, the height must also be smaller. Eliminate (A) and (B) because they would both make the height larger. To find the length of the new height, set up a proportion for. Cross-multiply to get (100)(52) = (65)(x). Simplify both sides of the equation to get 5,200 = 65x. Divide both sides of the equation by 65 to get 80 =x. Since the original height was 100, the change is 100 – 80 = 20.

The discriminant is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root sign and is written asD=b2– 4ac. When the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has exactly two real solutions; when the discriminant is 0, the quadratic has exactly one real solution; and when the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real solutions. Thus, the discriminant of this quadratic must equal a negative number. First, put the quadratic in standard form, which isax2+bx+c= 0, by adding 5xto both sides of the equation to get 10x2+ 5x+c= 0. Nowa= 10,b= 5, andc= c. Plug these into the discriminant formula to getD= (5)2 – 4(10)(c), orD= 25 – 40c. Next, plug in the values from the answer choices to see which value ofcmakes the discriminant negative. Start with a middle answer and try (C), 0.

Find theTotalby adding the four integers to getT= 114 + 109 + 106 + 111 = 440. The average formula becomes 440 = (A)(4). Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to getA= 110.

Start with the next smallest integer, 109, for the average, and solve for the fifth integer in the data set. The average formula becomesT= (109)(5), soT= 545.

Try (D) and follow the same steps. Label angleBas 40° and angleZas 63°. AngleCis again 63°. Solve for angleY: 77° +Y° + 63° = 180°, 140° +Y° = 180°, andY° = 40°. Label the triangles with this information to see that the triangles now have the same three angle measures. The answer is (D).close",
