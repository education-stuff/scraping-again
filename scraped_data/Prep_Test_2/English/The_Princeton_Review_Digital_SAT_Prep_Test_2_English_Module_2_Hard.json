The first part of the sentence states thatahelicopter landed…after completing a pioneering 24-mile flight,which is an independent clause. The second part sayspowered by a rechargeable battery and carrying a 50-pound weight…the fully electric helicopter was copiloted by Martine Rothblatt and Ric Webb,which is also an independent clause. Eliminate any answer that can’t correctly connect two independent clauses.(A) is wrong because a comma without a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS) can’t connect two independent clauses.(B) is wrong because a coordinating conjunction (and) without a comma can’t connect two independent clauses.(C) is wrong because some type of punctuation is needed in order to connect two independent clauses.(D) is correct because the period makes each independent clause its own sentence, which is fine.close",
