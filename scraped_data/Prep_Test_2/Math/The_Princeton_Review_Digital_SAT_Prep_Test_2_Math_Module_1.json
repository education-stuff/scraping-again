    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for a comparison of the means, or averages, of two data sets. One approach is to ballpark. Both data sets contain the numbers 3, 8, 8, 11, and 24. Data set S contains an additional, smaller number, so its mean will be less, which makes (C) correct.To solve mathematically, use the average formulaT=AN, in whichTis theTotal,Ais theAverage, andNis theNumber of things. There are 6 values in data set S, soN= 6. Find theTotalby adding the 6 integers to getT= 2 + 3 + 8 + 8 + 11 + 24 = 56. The average formula becomes 56 = (A)6. Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to get  =A, which means that the mean of data set S is . Repeat the same steps to find the mean of data set T. There are 5 values in data set T, soN= 5. Find theTotalby adding the 5 integers to getT= 3 + 8 + 8 + 11 + 24 = 54. The average formula becomes 54 = (A)(5). Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get 10.8 =A, which means that the mean of data set T is 10.8. Since  is less than 10.8, the mean of data set S is less than the mean of data set T.Using either method, the correct answer is (C).close",
