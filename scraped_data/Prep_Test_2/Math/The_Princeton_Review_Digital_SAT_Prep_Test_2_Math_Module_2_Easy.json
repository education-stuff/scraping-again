The question states that the factorymakes 1,200 vehicles in 1 day, but asks for the number of vehicles in 1week. There are 7 days in 1 week, so set up a proportion, being sure to match up the units. The proportion is. Cross-multiply to get (1)(x) = (1,200)(7), which becomesx= 8,400. Leave out the comma when entering the answer in the fill-in box. The correct answer is 8400.close",

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks which answer correctly compares the data represented by a dot plot to the data from a related data set. Range is easy to calculate, if necessary, so start there. Subtracting 8 from each value will not change the range because the greatest value and the least value will both decrease by 8, which means the difference between them will be the same in data set S as it is in data set R. Eliminate (A) and (B) because they say that the ranges are different, not equal. Mean is a measure of center, and the center will change when the values change. Subtracting 8 from every value will make the mean less, so the mean of data set S is less than the mean of data set R. Eliminate (C) because it says that the two means are equal.

Sincesalready represents the number of solo missions, 25 cannot represent the same thing; eliminate (C), so (D) must be correct. The question also states that 1,000 is the total points scored, so it makes sense that the two coefficients on the left side of the equation represent numbers of points per mission.

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for the number of solutions to a quadratic equation. One method is to use the built-in graphing calculator. Enter the equation without the “= 0” part to see a parabola, and then scroll and zoom to see how many times, if any, the parabola intersects thex-axis. There are two points of intersection, at (–0.5, 0) and (2.5, 0), so there are exactly two real solutions, and the answer is (B).To determine the number of solutions algebraically, use the discriminant. The discriminant is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root sign and is written asD=b2– 4ac. When the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has exactly two real solutions; when the discriminant is 0, the quadratic has exactly one real solution; and when the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real solutions. The quadratic is given in standard form,ax2+bx+c= 0, soa= 4,b= –8, andc= –5. The discriminant isD= (–8)2– 4(4)(–5), which becomesD= 64 + 80, and thenD= 144.

The equation of a circle in standard form is (x–h)2+ (y–k)2=r2, where (h,k) is the center andris the radius. Shifting a circle to the right 7 units does not change the radius, and all of the equations in the answer choices are equal to 64, so focus on the center. Moving a circle left or right does not change they-value. Eliminate (A) and (B) because the (y–k)2portion of the equation is different. To move a circle left or right, change thex-value. In circle R, (x–h) = (x+ 3), so –h= 3 andh= –3. Since thex-value of the center of circle R is –3, thex-coordinate of the center of circle S, which is shifted to the right 7 units, is –3 + 7 = 4. Thus, the value ofhin circle S is 4. The term (x– 4)2must appear in the correct answer, so eliminate (D).
