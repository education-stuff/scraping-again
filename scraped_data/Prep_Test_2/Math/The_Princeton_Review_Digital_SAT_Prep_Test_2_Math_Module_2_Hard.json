Other information about the concrete block is given, so use the units to determine what to do next.

Plug in the side lengths given in the question to getV= (1.1)(0.8)(0.8), orV= 0.704 cubic meters.

Angleqis a small angle, and angleris a big angle, so they add up to 180. Sinceq= 10c– 11 andr= 15c+ 41, add those expressions together and set them equal to 180.

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for the value of a percent decrease given a function that represents a specific situation. The value of the function is decreasing by a certain percent, so this question is about exponential decay. Write down the growth and decay formula:final amount= (original amount)(1 ±rate)number of changes. Thenumber of changesis given in terms of hours, but the question asks about the increaseevery 75 minutes.There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so set up a proportion:. Cross-multiply to get (1)(75) = (60)(h), or 75 = 60h. Divide both sides of the equation by 60 to get=h. Reduce the fraction to get=h. Now, plug inforhin the function to getM(h) =, which becomesM(h) = 302(0.87)1. The amount of the isotope is decreasing once, so 0.87 = 1 –rate. Addrateto both sides of the equation to getrate+ 0.87 = 1, and then subtract 0.87 from both sides of the equation to getrate= 0.13.

First, apply this formula to group X, in which there are 40 packages with a mean, or average, mass of 24 kg. In group X,N= 40 andA= 24. The average formula becomesT= (40)(24), orT= 960 kg. Now do the same for group Y, in which there are 110 packages with a mean, or average, mass of 9 kg. In group Y,N= 110 andA= 9. The average formula becomesT= (110)(9), orT= 990 kg. Now calculate the average of all 150 packages. The number of packages combined is given as 150, and the total of the masses of all of the packages is 960 + 990 = 1,950 kg.

The discriminant is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root sign, and it can be written asD=b2– 4ac. When the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has exactly two real solutions; when the discriminant is 0, the quadratic has exactly one real solution; and when the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real solutions.

However, the equation of this circle is not in standard form, so look for another way to find the radius. One method is to complete the square for both terms in order to put the equation in standard form. A much simpler approach is to enter the equation into the built-in graphing calculator.

Four of the gray dots are where the circle intercepts thex- andy-axes. Click on the other two dots, which are at the top and bottom of the circle and form the diameter. The points are (0.25, –0.75) and (0.25, 1.25). They have the samex-coordinate, so the distance between the two points, or the diameter, is the difference between they-coordinates: 1.25 – (–0.75) = 2.

The question states that the vertex of the parabola is at (–1, 4), and that the parabola does not intersect thex-axis. Since they-coordinate of the vertex is positive and the parabola does not intersect thex-axis, the parabola must open upwards. The vertex of a parabola is expressed as (h,k). Use this information to rewrite the parabola in vertex form, which isy =a(x–h)2+k. Plug in the values forhandkfrom the vertex to gety = a(x+ 1)2+ 4. Expand (x+ 1)2using FOIL to gety = a(x2+ 2x+ 1) + 4. Next, distribute theato gety = ax2+ 2ax+a+ 4. Finally, since this vertex form of the parabola is equal to the given standard form of the same parabola, set them equal to each other:ax2+ 2ax+a+ 4 =ax2+bx+c. Write the two equations above each other to see the matching terms more clearly:ax2+ 2ax+a+ 4ax2+bx+cGiven this, theax2terms cancel, 2a=banda+ 4 =c.Thus,a–b–cbecomesa– 2a– (a+ 4).

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for a measurement of a geometric figure. Use the Geometry Basic Approach. Because the surface area of a 3-dimensional figure is the sum of the areas of its faces, draw three rectangles of different sizes to represent the faces of the rectangular solid. Label the height of 50 on two of the rectangles. Since the question asks for a specific value and the answers contain numbers in increasing order, plug in the answers. Rewrite the answer choices on the scratch paper and label them as “side length of base.” Next, start with a number in the middle and try (B), 6. Label the remaining sides lengths of the rectangles as 6. The figures should now look something like this:Use the formula for the area of a rectangle,A=lw, to find the area of each face. One 6 × 50 face has an area of 300, and one 6 × 6 face has an area of 36. There are 4 faces with an area of 300 and 2 faces with an area of 36 for a surface area of (4)(300) + (2)(36) = 1,200 + 72 = 1,272. Thus,S= 1,272.If the two prisms were cut into two identical prisms parallel to the square base, the resulting shapes would each be a shorter rectangular prism with a height of= 25 and a square base with a side length of 6. Perform the same calculations to find the surface area of one of the smaller prisms. One 6 × 25 face has an area of 150, and one 6 × 6 face has an area of 36. There are 4 faces with an area of 150 and 2 faces with an area of 36 for a surface area of (4)(150) + (2)(36) = 600 + 72 = 672. The question states thateach resulting prism has a surface area ofS, so plug in 1,272 forS. The result is(1,272) ≈ 704. This does not match the surface area of one of the smaller prisms, so eliminate (B).It might be difficult to determine whether a larger or smaller number is needed, so pick a direction and try (C), 12. The dimensions of the original single prism are now 50 × 12 × 12. There are four faces with an area of (50)(12) = 600 and two faces with an area of (12)(12) = 144 for a surface area of (4)(600) + (2)(144) = 2,400 + 288 = 2,688. The dimensions of one of the smaller prisms are now 25 × 12 × 12. There are four faces with an area of (25)(12) = 300 and two faces with an area of (12)(12) = 144 for a surface area of (4)(300) + (2)(144) = 1,200 + 288 = 1,488. Plug in 2,688 forSto get(2,688) = 1,488. This is the surface area of one of the smaller prisms, so stop here. The correct answer is (C).close",
