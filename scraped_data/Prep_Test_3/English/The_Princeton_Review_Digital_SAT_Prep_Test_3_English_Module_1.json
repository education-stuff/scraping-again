The last sentence of the text states thatDue to these potential benefits, investors and entrepreneurs alike have shown interest in extracting alginate from sargassum despite the often-shifting locations from which sargassum can be harvested. Since the other sentences introduce sargassum and explain the benefits of alginate, which is obtained from sargassum, the last sentence serves as the main idea. The correct answer should be as consistent as possible with the last sentence.(A) and (D) are wrong because they goBeyond the Text—the texture of alginate may sounddispleasingbut the text does not call it such, and no group in the text calls fora synthetic version of alginateto be made, even if such alternatives are often created in the real world.(B) is wrong because it’s theOppositeof the text—the text describes alginate isusefulfor building rather thannot suitable.(C) is correct because it’s consistent with the main idea of the text—it paraphrases everything that’s said in the last sentence of the text.close",
