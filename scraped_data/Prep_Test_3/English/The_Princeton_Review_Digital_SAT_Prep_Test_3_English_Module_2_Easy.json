The team facilitated conflicts between clownfish of different sizes—the larger fish always won the battles while the smaller fish adopted a side-lying position. When artificial UV light was applied to cancel out the natural coloring pattern on the smaller fish, the larger fish no longer challenged the smaller fish. The scientists determined that smaller clownfish have more UV white and orange coloring than larger fish, which, according to the team, indicates their submissiveness to the larger clownfish.",
