Super Kabuki productions have taken themes from manga, or Japanese illustrated novels, such asNarutoorOne Piece.

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationIn this Rules question, punctuation is changing in the answer choices. Look for independent clauses. The first part of the sentence saysNeuroscientist Sophie Schwartz and her team at the University of Geneva recently discovered that altering the emotions of dreamers can lead to a reduction in frequency of nightmares, which is an independent clause. The second part saysparticipants who received an intervention focused on emotional regulation reported fewer nightmares than did those who received a control intervention, which is also an independent clause. Eliminate any answer that can’t correctly connect two independent clauses.(A) is correct because a colon can connect two independent clauses if the second one explains the first, as it does here.(B) is wrong because some type of punctuation is needed in order to connect two independent clauses.(C) is wrong because a comma without a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS) can’t connect two independent clauses.(D) is wrong because the two ideas don’t contrast.close",
