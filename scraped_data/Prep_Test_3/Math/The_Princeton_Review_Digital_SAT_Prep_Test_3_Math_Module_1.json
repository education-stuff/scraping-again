One method is to enter both equations into the built-in calculator, then plug in values forcfrom the answer choices. Use the slider that pops up in the calculator or enter the possible values ofcone at a time. Whenc= ­–0.5, the graph shows 2 solutions; eliminate (A).

The new equation becomes –4 = 4x2– 12x+c. Put the quadratic in standard form by setting one side equal to 0. Add 4 to both sides of the equation to get 0 = 4x2– 12x+ 4 +c.

When the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has exactly two real solutions; when the discriminant is 0, the quadratic has exactly one real solution; and when the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real solutions. In this case, the quadratic has no real solutions, so the discriminant must be negative.With the equation in standard form, which isax2+bx+c= 0,a= 4,b= –12, andc= (4 +c).

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for the slope of a line. The question states thatlines k and l are parallel, which means they have the same slope. The question gives the equation of linek, so find the slope of that line. First, convert the equation of linekinto slope-intercept form,y=mx+b, in whichmis the slope andbis they-intercept. Add 15xto both sides of the equation to get –5y= 15x+ 3. Divide both sides of the equation by –5 to gety= –3x–. The slope of linekis thus –3.It is also possible to convert the equation of linekinto standard form by switching the two terms on the left to get –15x– 5y= 3. In standard form,Ax+By=C, the slope is. In this case,A= –15 andB= –5, so the slope of linekis= –3. Since lineskandlhave the same slope, the slope of linelis also –3.Using either form of a linear equation, the correct answer is (A).close",

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for a description of a function that models a specific situation. Compare the answer choices. Two choices say the function is increasing, and two say it is decreasing. The values in the table for the number of bacteria get smaller as the values for time get bigger, so the function is decreasing. Eliminate (C) and (D) because they describe an increasing function. The difference between (A) and (B) is whether the function is linear or exponential. Determine this by testing pairs of values from the table. When the time increases by 2 hours from 0 to 2, the number of bacteria decreases by 1,000,000 – 100,000 = 900,000. When the time increases by 2 hours from 2 to 4, the number of bacteria decreases by 100,000 – 10,000 = 90,000. The value decreased by 900,000 during the first 2 hours and by 90,000 during the next 2 hours. A linear function would change by the same amount over each interval, so eliminate (B).
