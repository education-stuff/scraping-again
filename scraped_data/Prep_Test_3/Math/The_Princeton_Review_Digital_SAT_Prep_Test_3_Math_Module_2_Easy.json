Body weight is on thex-axis, so find the species with the greatest body weight by finding the point that is the farthest to the right. This is the point above the body weight of about 125 on thex-axis. Brain weight is on they-axis, so look left from that point to they-axis, using the mouse pointer or the edge of the scratch paper as a ruler. The value on they-axis for the point with a body weight of 125 on thex-axis is 140, so the species with the greatest body weight has a brain weight of 140 grams. The correct answer is (D).close",

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for the best comparison of the means, or averages, for two groups shown in a frequency table. For averages, use the formulaT = AN,in whichTis theTotal,Ais theAverage, andNis theNumber of things. The question states that each group has 200 students, so that is theNumber of things. Since theNumber of thingsis the same, the group with the greater total will have the greater average. Use the frequency table to ballpark theTotal. A frequency table has two columns: the left-hand column contains the values, and the right-hand column contains the number of times each value occurs, or its frequency. In group 1, for example, 25 students studied for an average of 1 hour per night and 80 students studied for an average of 2 hours per night. In group 2, on the other hand, 25 students studied for an average of 0 hours per night and 80 students studied for an average of 1 hour per night. This pattern is consistent throughout the table, with the same number of students studying for 1 hour less in group 2 than in group 1. Thus, the mean for group 1 is greater than the mean for group 2, which matches (D).It is also possible to find theTotalusing the frequency table. Multiply each value by the number of times it occurs and add the results. For group 1, multiply 0 × 0, 1 × 25, 2 × 80, 3 × 50, 4 × 35, and 5 × 10. Add the results to get 0 + 25 + 160 + 150 + 140 + 50 = 525. Plug 525 for theTotaland 200 for theNumber of thingsinto the average formula to get 525 = (A)(200). Divide both sides of the equation by 200 to getA= 2.625. The same calculations for values in group 2 give aTotalof 325 and anAverageof 1.625. The average for group 1 is greater than the average for group 2.Using either method, the correct answer is (D).close",

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for the measure of an angle and gives conflicting units. Either write down a conversion between radians and degrees from memory or open the reference sheet, which states that thenumber of degrees of arc in a circle is 360and that thenumber of radians of arc in a circle is 2π. Thus, 360 degrees = 2π radians. This reduces to the other conversion, which is 180 degrees = π radians. Set up a proportion, being sure to match up units. The proportion is=. Cross-multiply to get (π)(x) = (180). Simplify to get πx= 80π, then divide both sides of the equation by π to getx= 80. The correct answer is 80.close",

One method is to enter both equations into the built-in graphing calculator, then scroll and zoom as needed to find the point(s) of intersection. The graph shows one point of intersection at (4, –4), which is (C).Another approach is to plug in the answers. Rewrite the answer choices on the scratch paper and label them “(x,y).” Start with (A) and plugx= –5 andy= 4 into the first equation. The equation becomes 5(–5) – 4(4) = 36, or –25 – 16 = 36, and then –41 = 36. This is not true, so eliminate (A). A positive value ofxwill make the left side of the first equation greater, so try (C) next. Plugx= 4 andy= –4 into the first equation to get 5(4) – 4(–4) = 36, which becomes 20 + 16 = 36, and then 36 = 36. This is true, but the solution must work in both equations. Plug the point in (C) into the second equation to get –4 – (–4) = 0, which becomes –4 + 4 = 0 or 0 = 0.

Start by reading the final question, which asks for the best interpretation of they-intercept of the graph. Put the given equation into slope-intercept form by swapping the two terms on the right side of the equation:C= –1.5w+ 12. In slope-intercept form,y=mx+b,bis they-intercept. Thus, 12 would be they-intercept if this equation were graphed.Now, label the parts of the equation with the information given, and eliminate answers that do not match the labels. Sincewrepresents the number of weeks and 12 is not multiplied byw, 12 is not related to weeks. Eliminate (B) and (D) because they refer to weeks. SinceCrepresents an amount in dollars, the right side of the equation must also be an amount in dollars. Eliminate (C) because it refers to a number of books, not an amount. To check, plug in 0 forwand the equation becomesC= –1.5(0) + 12, orC= 12. This means that Dave owed the library 12 dollars at week 0 before he started paying the fine.

Click on the two dots at the top and bottom of the circle that form the diameter. The points are (2.5, 6.5) and (2.5, –3.5).
