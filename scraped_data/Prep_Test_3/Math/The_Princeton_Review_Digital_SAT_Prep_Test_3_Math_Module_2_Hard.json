    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for the function that represents values given in a table. In function notation, the number inside the parentheses is thex-value that goes into the function, or the input, and the value that comes out of the function is they-value, or the output. Together, they represent points on a graph. One method is to enter each equation from the answer choices into the built-in calculator, then scroll and zoom as needed to see which graph contains the points (0, –19), (1, –10), and (2, 5). Only the graph of the equation in (C) contains all three points, so it must be correct.Another method is to plug in. The table provides three pairs of input and output values, and the correct equation must work for every pair of values. Plug in values from the table and eliminate functions that don’t work. Because 0 and 1 are likely to make more than one answer work, try the last row of the table and plugx= 2 andh(x) = 5 into the answer choices. Choice (A) becomes 5 = 22+ 10(2) – 19. Simplify to get 5 = 4 + 20 – 19, and then 5 = 5. This is true, but the correct answer must work for every pair of values, so plug inx= 1 andh(x) = –10 from the table. The equation in (A) becomes –10 = 12+ 10(1) – 19, then –10 = 1 + 10 – 19, and finally –10 = –8. This is not true, so eliminate (A).Next, plugx= 2 andh(x) = 5 into the equation in (B) to get 5 = 2(2)2+ 7(2) – 19, which becomes 5 = 2(4) + 14 – 19, then 5 = 8 + 14 – 19, and finally 5 = 3. Eliminate (B). Plugx= 2 andh(x) = 5 into the equation in (C) to get 5 = 3(2)2+ 6(2) – 19, which becomes 5 = 3(4) + 12 – 19, then 5 = 12 + 12 – 19, and finally 5 = 5. Keep (C) and try another pair of values. Plugx= 1 andh(x) = –10 into the equation in (C) to get –10 = 3(1)2+ 6(1) – 19, which becomes –10 = 3(1) + 6 – 19, then –10 = 3 + 6 – 19, and finally –10 = –10. To confirm that the equation in (C) is correct, plug inx= 0 andh(x) = –19 to get –19 = 3(0)2+ 6(0) – 19, which becomes –19 = 3(0) + 0 – 19. then –19 = 3 + 0 – 19, and finally–19 = –19.

Adding a value of 4 to data set 1 to create data set 2 changes the minimum value from 5 to 4. The maximum value remains unchanged, so the difference between the maximum and the minimum values changes by 5 – 4 = 1. The difference between the greatest and least values in a list is the range, so the range of data set 2 is 1 more than the range of data set 1.Work with the median next. The median of a list of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. In lists with an even number of numbers, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Data set 1 contains 9 numbers, so its median is the number in the middle. Cross out values from each end to see that the median of data set 1 is 7. Data set 2 contains 10 numbers, so its median is the average of the 5th and 6th numbers. Count to see that the 5th and 6th numbers are both 7, so the median of data set 2 is also 7. The median does not change at all between data set 1 and data set 2, and nothing can change by less than 0, so (D) must be correct.

When a line intersects two parallel lines, two kinds of angles are created: big and small. All of the small angles are equal to each other, all of the big angles are equal to each other, and any small angle plus any big angle = 180°. Anglehand anglejare both small angles, soh=j. Sinceh= 5a+ 6 andj= 9a– 26, set these expressions equal to each other and solve to find the value ofa. The equation becomes 5a+ 6 = 9a– 26. Subtract 5afrom both sides of the equation to get 6 = 4a– 26. Add 26 to both sides of the equation to get 32 = 4a. Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to get 8 =a. Plug this value into either equation to get the measure of one small angle. The first equation becomesh= 5(8) + 6, thenh= 40 + 6, and finallyh= 46. Be careful: the question asks for the value ofk, which is a big angle. Since the measure of any small angle plus the measure of any big angle = 180°, the measure of big anglekis 180 – 46 = 134.

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for a change in a value based on a function. In function notation, the number inside the parentheses is thex-value that goes into the function, and the value that comes out of the function is they-value. Since the question is about the relationship between variables, plug in two different values for the number of units,u, to determine the decrease in costC. Start by plugging in a number that makes the math easy and will be easy to decrease by 20, such as 30 units of the product. The equation becomesC(30) = 60(30) + 300, thenC(30) = 1,800 + 300, and finallyC(30) = 2,100. The question states thatthe number of units is decreased by 20, so plug 30 – 20 = 10 into the function. The equation becomesC(10) = 60(10) + 300, thenC(10) = 600 + 300, and finallyC(10) = 900. The cost decreased by 2,100 – 900 = 1,200 dollars. The correct answer is (C).close",

The question asks about the relationship between variables and there are variables in the answer choices, so plug in.

Choice (A) becomes 15 = 15(101 – 1), and then 15 = 15(100). Any number raised to the power of zero is 1, so this becomes 15 = 15(1), or 15 = 15.

Start by converting the amount of oil in the 55-gallon drum into cubic feet. The question provides the conversion between gallons and cubic feet, so set up a proportion, being sure to match up units. The proportion is. Cross-multiply to get (1)(x) = (0.133)(55), which becomesx= 7.315 cubic feet of oil in the drum. Next, calculate the volume of one cylindrical bucket. Write down the formula for the volume of a cylinder, either from memory or after looking it up on the reference sheet. The formula isV= πr2h. Plug in the given values of 1.5 for the height and 0.5 for the radius to getV= π(0.5)2(1.5), which becomesV= 0.375π, orV≈ 1.178 cubic feet.

Either enter the equation the way it is to see vertical lines at the solutions or leave out “= 0” to see a parabola. Either way, the coordinates of the solutions are (–5.243, 0) and (3.243, 0).Next, plug in each answer choice forpuntil one of them makes –1 +equal one of the solutions. Start with one of the middle numbers and try (B), 6. Enter –1 +into the calculator to get approximately 6.348. This is not equal to either of the solutions, so eliminate (B). The result was larger than either solution, so try (A), 2, next. Enter –1 +into the calculator to get approximately 3.243. The matches one of the solutions to the equation, so stop here. The correct answer is (A).close",

    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe question asks for the function that represents a certain situation. In function notation, the number inside the parentheses is thex-value that goes into the function, or the input, and the value that comes out of the function is they-value, or the output. The question gives an input value of 100 flyers and an output value of $17. Plug these into the functions in the answer choices, and eliminate any that do not work. Choice (A) becomes 17 = 0.10(100) + 7, or 17 = 10 + 7, and then 17 = 17. This is true, so keep (A), but check the remaining answers. Choice (B) becomes 17 = 0.10(100) + 17, or 17 = 10 + 17, and then 17 = 27. This is not true, so eliminate (B). Choice (C) becomes 17 = 0.12(100) + 17, or 17 = 12 + 17, and then 17 = 29; eliminate (C). Choice (D) becomes 17 = 0.17(100), or 17 = 17; keep (D).Two answers worked with the first pair of values, so plug in a different value forx. The question states that the cost for 350 flyers is $42, so plug these input and output values into the remaining answers. Choice (A) becomes 42 = 0.10(350) + 7, or 42 = 35 + 7, and then 42 = 42; keep (A). Choice (D) becomes 42 = 0.17(350), or 42 = 59.5; eliminate (D). The correct answer is (A).close",
