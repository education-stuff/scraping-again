The last sentence states thatOellermann suggests that because of known data…approximations of the Greenland shark’s lifespan will be similar regardless of the research methods chosen to analyze it. The correct answer should offer accurate information from the table in support of this suggestion.(A) is correct because it’s consistent with the highlighted suggestion—if all four approximations used different methods but fall in the same general range, this would be identical to what Oellermann argued.(B) and (D) are wrong because they’reHalf-Right—the correct answer should state that different approximation methods arrived at similar, not different, conclusions regarding lifespan. Note that the first half of (D) does not directly contradict the claim, but the second half of (D) does, as the approximations of shark lifespan are supposed to be similar based on Oellermann’s suggestion.(C) is wrong because it’s irrelevant to the claim—only citing a single study does not allow for a comparison between research methods.close",

It is believed that approximately two million years ago, pandas switched to a diet that was exclusively bamboo based, but before then they subsisted on a diet that included both plants and meat. To investigate this further, Fuwen Wei and researchers with the Chinese Academy of Sciences compared ancient panda tooth samples to more modern panda tooth samples. Discovering that the ancient panda tooth samples have a more varied collection of scrapes and scratches on them than modern panda teeth do, Wei hypothesized that a wider variety of scrapes and scratches indicates a wider variety of foods consumed; this, therefore, would mean that ancient pandas did indeed have a more diverse diet than do their modern counterparts.",
