Subtract 7xfrom both sides of the equation to get 3x2+ 30x+ 84 = –k, then addkto both sides of the equation go get 3x2+ 30x+ 84 +k= 0.The question states thatthe given system of equations has exactly one real solution, so use the discriminant. The discriminant is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root sign, and it can be written asD=b2– 4ac. When the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has exactly two real solutions; when the discriminant is 0, the quadratic has exactly one real solution; and when the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real solutions. In this case, the quadratic has exactly one real solution, so the discriminant must equal 0.With the equation in standard form, which isax2+bx+c= 0,a= 3,b= 30, andc= 84 +k. Plug these values into the discriminant formula and set it equal to 0 to get 0 = (30)2– 4(3)(84 +k). Square 30 and distribute the 4(3) to get 0 = 900 – 1,008 – 12k. Simplify further to get 0 = –108 – 12k, then add 108 to both sides of the equation to get 108 = –12k.
