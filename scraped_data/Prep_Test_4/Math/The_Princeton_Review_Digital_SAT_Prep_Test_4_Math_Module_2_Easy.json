One method is to enter both equations into the built-in graphing calculator, then scroll and zoom as needed to find the point(s) of intersection. The graph shows one point of intersection at(–18, –6), which is (B).Another approach is to plug in the answers. Rewrite the answer choices on the scratch paper and label them “(x,y).” Start with (A) and plugx= –20 andy= –8 into the easier second equation. The equation becomes 3(–8) = –20, or –24 = –20. This is not true, so eliminate (A). Try (B) next and plugx= –18 andy= –6 into the second equation to get 3(–6) = –18, or –18 = –18. This is true, but the solution must work in both equations. Plug the point in (B) into the first equation to get –12 = –18 – (–6), which becomes –12 = –18 + 6, and then –12 = –12 .

Since the question asks for a specific value and the answers contain numbers in increasing order, plug in the answers. Rewrite the answer choices on the scratch paper and label them “number of packages.” Next, pick a value to start with. Since the question asks for the maximum, start with the largest number, 46.If there are 46 packages and each package weighs 15 kilograms, the total weight is (46)(15) = 690 kilograms. Add the weight of the cart for a combined weight of 690 + 50 = 740 kilograms. This is too big, so eliminate (D) and try another number. Try (C), and make the number of packages 44. If there are 44 packages with a weight of 15 kilograms each, the weight of the packages is (44)(15) = 660 kilograms. Add the weight of the cart for a combined weight of 660 + 50 = 710 kilograms. The combined weight is still greater than 700 pounds, so eliminate (C). The result was close, so (B) is likely correct. To check, make the number of packages 43. If there are 43 packages with a weight of 15 kilograms each, the weight of the packages is (43)(15) = 645 kilograms. Add the weight of the cart for a combined weight of 695 kilograms. This is less than 700, so 43 is the maximum number of packages that can be on the cart without going over the elevator’s weight limit. The correct answer is (B).close",
