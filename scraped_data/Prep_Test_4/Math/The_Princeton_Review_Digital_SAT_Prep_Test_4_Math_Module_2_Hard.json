For averages, use the formulaT = AN,in whichTis theTotal,Ais theAverage, andNis theNumber of things. The question states that there are 54 employees in each department, so that is theNumber of things. Since theNumber of thingsis the same, the department with the larger total will have the greater average. Use the frequency table to ballpark theTotal. A frequency table has two columns: the left-hand column contains the values, and the right-hand column contains the number of times each value occurs, or its frequency. In the Accounting department, for example, 1 occurs 19 times and 5 occurs 6 times. In the Marketing department, on the other hand, 1 occurs only 6 times and 5 occurs 19 times. The department with a greater number of large values will have a greater total, so estimate that the average of the Marketing department is greater than that of the Accounting department, which matches (C).It is also possible to find theTotalusing the frequency table. Multiply each value by the number of times it occurs, and add the results. For the Accounting department, multiply 1 × 19, 2 × 14, 3 × 7, 4 × 8, and 5 × 6. Add the results to get 19 + 28 + 21 + 32 + 30 = 130. Plug 130 for theTotaland 54 for theNumber of thingsinto the average formula to get 130 = (A)(54). Divide both sides of the equation by 54 to getA≈ 2.41. The same calculations for values in the Marketing department give aTotalof 202 and anAverageof ≈ 3.74. The average for the Marketing department, 3.74, is greater than the average for the Accounting department, 2.41.Using either method, the correct answer is (C).close",

Subtracttxfrom both sides of the first equation to get –tx+ 63y– 2.1 = 0. Add 2.1 to both sides of the equation to get –tx+ 63y= 2.1. The equation is now in standard form, which isAx+By=C.

Write the two equations above each other to see how the terms match up:–tx+ 63y= 2.14x+   9y= 0.3Now that the two equations are in the same form, manipulate the second equation so that the coefficients on theyterms are the same.

These are the approximate target values; write them down and circle them.Now plugk= 2 into the answer choices and eliminate any that do not match either of the target values. Choice (A) becomes 3(2) = 6. This is not close to –83 or 83, so eliminate (A). Choice (B) becomes=. Use a calculator to get a result of ≈ 82.78. This is slightly less than 83, so keep (B) but check the remaining answers just in case. Choice (C) becomes=.  Use a calculator to get a result of ≈ 83.21. This is close, but the positive solution on the graph is less than 83, not greater than 83, so eliminate (C). Choice (D) becomes 832+ 9(2)2= 6,880 + 36 = 6,925, which is much too large; eliminate (D). Only (B) is left, and it is correct.To solve algebraically, first add 83 to both sides of the equation to get= 83 –, then addto both sides of the equation to get+= 83. Both fractions on the left side of the equation have the same denominator, so add the numerators to get= 83. Square both sides of the equation to get= 832. One of the binomials on the left side of the equation cancels, leaving 9k2+x2= 832. Now solve forx. Subtract 9k2from both sides of the equation to getx2= 832– 9k2. Take the square root of both sides of the equation to getx=, which is (B).Using either method, the correct answer is (B).close",
