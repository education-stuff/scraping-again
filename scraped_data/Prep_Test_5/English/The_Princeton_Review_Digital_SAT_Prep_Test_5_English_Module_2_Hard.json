In the first equation, we can substitute 10 into `y`, get `10 = x^2 + 4x + c` and further simplify it into `0 = x^2 + 4x + (c - 10)`. For a quadratic equation to have just 1 solution, the two factors must be the same, such as `(x + 5)` and `(x + 5)`. Since coefficient of the `x` term (which is `4` from `4x` in the equation) is the sum of the 2 constants in the factors (`5` in the `(x + 5)` example above), dividing the `4` in `4x` by `2` gives you `2`, which means the factors are `(x + 2)` and `(x + 2)`. Multiplying them, we get `(x + 2)(x + 2) = x^2 + 4x + 4`, and the equation above was `0 = x^2 + 4x + (c - 10)`. Putting these two equations together, `4 = (c - 10)`, so `c = 14.`close",
