Plugging in `(1, 7)` for `(x, y)`, and only choice B works: `7 = 3(1) + 4 = 7`.close",

To double the number of bacteria, `f(t)` needs to be `53000 * 2`, which means it doubles when `2^(t/360) = 2`. This means `t/360 = 1`, so `t = 360`.close",

The first integer must be smaller because it’s 5 less than half of the second integer. If the smaller integer is 5, then the second, bigger integer is `5 = x/2 - 5`, which gets `x = 20`. The product of the two number is `5 * 20 = 100`, so A is wrong. Repeating the process with 10 from choice B, you get the bigger number equals to 30, and 10 * 30 = 300.close",
