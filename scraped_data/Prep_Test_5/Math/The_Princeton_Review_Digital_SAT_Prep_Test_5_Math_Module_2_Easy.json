    "explanation": "✕ExplanationThe easiest way is to first plug the 4 equations into the graphing calculator. `f(x)` looks just like choice A. Remember that `g(x) = f(x-2)` means shifting the graph to the right by 2 units, which is the blue graph.You can also pick an easy point from the original graph—for example, (6, 2) is a point on the graph. Substituting the point into `f(x)`, you get `6 = a / (6-b)`. Even though you don’t know what `a` and `b` are, you know that `g(x) = f(x-2)`, which means `g(x)` looks just like `f(x)` but moved 2 units to the right. Realizing from choices A, B, and C that `g(x)` probably looks like `6 / (x - \"something\")`, we can try to make `a=6` since the denominator for the fraction in `g(x)` is 6. That means `b = 3` for `f(x)` to work: substituting `f(x) = 2`, `x=6`, `a=6` and `b=3`, you get `f(x) = 2 = 6/(6-3)`. By graphing `f(x) = 6/(x-3)`, you see that it indeed is `f(x)`.
