Therefore, the total height of the trees in data set A is 15 * 60 = 900 meters.In data set B, the mean height is 25 meters, and there are 40 trees. Therefore, the total height of the trees in data set B is 25 * 40 = 1000 meters.In data set C, the total number of trees is 100, so the total height of the trees in data set C is 900 + 1000 = 1900 meters.To find the mean, we divide the total height by the total number of trees: Mean of data set C = 1900 / 100 = 19 meters.Therefore, the mean of data set C is 20 meters.close",
