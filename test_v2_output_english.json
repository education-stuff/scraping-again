  "explanation": "<h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-3\">Explanation</h2>\n<div>\n<p>This is a Vocabulary question, as it’s asking for a <em>logical and precise word or phrase </em>for the blank<em>.</em> Read the text and highlight what can help fill in the blank. The text states that <em>When</em> <em>microdroplets of water hit a solid surface, an electric charge </em>produces <em>hydroxyl radicals that in turn combine with remaining oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide. </em>This information describes a chain of events started by water, so a good phrase for the annotation box would be “likely to trigger something.”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(A), (B), and (C) are wrong because <em>viable, contaminated, </em>and <em>common</em> don’t match “likely to trigger something.”<br/><br/></li>\n<li>(D) is correct because <em>reactive</em> matches “likely to trigger something.”</li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
